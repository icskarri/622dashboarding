Getting started with visualizing data logged from IoT devices.
The simple_visualization.html file contains the output from running the ipynb file. I used the Pandas and Seaborn libraries, and also included the data file in this repo `data_log.csv`. This is just something I'm using as a way to get started.
The simple_visualization.ipynb file provides a view of the rendered output the Jupyter Notebook file. Please look at that one for reviewing this submission.
